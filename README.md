# TaskManger
# Task Management System

## Overview
The **Task Management System** is a simple console-based application written in Java that allows users to manage tasks. It provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for tasks using an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.

## Features
- **Add Task:** Users can create new tasks with a title and description.
- **View Tasks:** Displays a list of all tasks with their IDs, titles, and descriptions.
- **Update Task:** Allows users to modify a task's title and description based on the task ID.
- **Delete Task:** Removes a task from the list using its ID.
- **Simple UI:** The application runs in a console environment with an easy-to-use menu system.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Data Storage:** In-memory list (ArrayList)
- **User Interaction:** Console-based input/output
